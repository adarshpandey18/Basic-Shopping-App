# Shopping App

This is a Flutter mobile application that allows users to browse and shop for sneakers.

## Current State

The project is currently in development and has the following features implemented:

- Displaying a list of products.
- Viewing detailed product information.
- Adding products to the shopping cart.
- Removing products from the shopping cart.

However, there are a couple of issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Categories Based on Company:** Products should be categorized based on the company or brand, but this feature is not yet implemented.

2. **Search Functionality:** The search option is not working, preventing users from searching for specific products.

## Screenshots
